        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound fresh spinach leaves, washed and chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons red palm oil (or vegetable oil if unavailable)</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 medium tomatoes, diced</li>
            <li>1 bell pepper, chopped</li>
            <li>1-2 scotch bonnet peppers, finely chopped (optional for heat)</li>
            <li>1 cup dried fish or shrimp (optional)</li>
            <li>1 bouillon cube (chicken or vegetable)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>       
            <li>Wash and chop the spinach leaves.</li>
            <li>Finely chop the onion, garlic, tomatoes, and bell pepper.</li>
            <li>If using dried fish or shrimp, soak them in warm water for about 10 minutes, then drain.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the red palm oil over medium heat. If using vegetable oil, heat until shimmering.</li>    
            <li>Add the chopped onions and garlic to the pan. Sauté for about 3-4 minutes, until the onions become translucent and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add the diced tomatoes and bell pepper to the pan. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomato  break down and the mixture becomes saucy.</li>
            <li>If using dried fish or shrimp, add them to the pan now. Stir to combine and cook for another 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped spinach to the pan. It may seem like a lot at first, but the spinach will wilt significantly as it cooks. Stir well to coat the spinach with the tomato mixture.</li>
            <li>Crumble the bouillon cube into the pan and stir to combine. Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>If you like your dish spicy, add the finely chopped scotch bonnet peppers. Be cautious with the amount, as they are very hot.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low and let the spinach cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it is fully wilt and all the flavors are well combined.</li>
            <li>Once the spinach is tender and well-cooked, remove the pan from the heat. Serve the Liberian fried spinach hot, as a side dish to rice, fufu, or boiled plantains.</li>              
        </ol>
